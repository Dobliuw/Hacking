# Dobliuw Hacking notes 

-----

Welcome everyone, these are my notes, throughout my time in the world of technology, more specifically in Cybersecurity, I took the trouble to make explanatory notes of the concepts learned, uses made, technologies and automated tools learned, etc.

----

So the content that everyone will see here is basically:
- RedTeam (Offensive hacking, exploits, privilege escalations, technologies, protocols, networks and more).
- BlueTeam (Defensive hacking, analysis, tools, this is the weakest branch of my notes).

-----

I invite you to clone the repository and use the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) tool to read or/and modify the notes.

PS: The notes were made in Obsidian with the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) Plugin and the Border theme
